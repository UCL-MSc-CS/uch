# UCH
An e-Health patient management system that simplifies appointment bookings for patients and GPs of University College Hospital (UCH).

## Getting Started
This is a CLI (command line interface) application, and it can be run by cloning the source code to your local computer. Some aspects of this application have a graphical user interface.

The following libraries were used in this project and will have to be installed in order to run the code.
1.Pandas
2.Pillow
If an error is thrown, asking for installation of these libraries, run the following command in terminal - "pip install <name of library here>" 
To run the program, type 'python .\root.py'. You can then login with any of the accounts already created (details given below). 
The sqlite3 database file, UCH.db, should be created automatically the first time the program is run. If it isn't, run database.py in the terminal.
The GUI windows in this program are designed for 1080p resolution and 100% text scaling. Please check your display settings in case the windows are not displaying fully.
